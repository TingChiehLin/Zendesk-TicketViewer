## Process & Decision Making

#### Why did I choose Next.js and React.js for the coding challenge?

From my research, I can see Zendesk use React.js library to develop front-end and this is also my favourite tech so why
not I use it to develop the application. Moreover, Next.js is ```pre server-side-rendering``` which enables Zendesk to
accept a lot of requests in order to provide better user experience. Furthermore, Next.js is a good for full-stack
development.

#### TailwildCSS is to develop as fast as possible

I used TailwildCSS is because there are two reasons. One is CSS-JS; thus, rendering styling is better. The second one is
that TailwildCSS allows me to use their default design system so I am able to focus on my coding.

#### Encoding my API Key token

The first difficult is encoding in Javascript. This issue made me confused for a long time. However, I check resources
from [Encoing Base64](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/246801/how-can-you-encode-a-string-to-base64-in-javascript)
to try to solve my problems but it does not run on the server side so I keep looking for further
details [Buffers in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffers_and_character_encodings)
and then I am able to fetch data.

#### Fetch API

I use [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to fetch data. To fetch loading data. I do not use ``useEffect``. Instead,
I utilised ``getStaticProps``.

#### Test-driven development

- Testing Ticket Item whether it renders correctly including testing data.

- Testing Ticket List whether it renders all ticket items correctly.

#### Design

I follow Zendesk Design System to create ticket viewer by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

[Zendesk Brand](https://brandland.zendesk.com/brand-identity)

[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mo#standard-styles) is my main font instead of Proxima
Nova
